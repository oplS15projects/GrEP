{"name":"GrEP","tagline":"Dual-Core Processor's OPLS15 Project.","body":"##Authors\r\nOur team, Dual-Core Processors, consists of Michael Forsyth, Nicholas Forsyth, and Emily Seto.\r\n\r\n##Overview\r\nOur project is called the Graph-ical Emulation Program (also known as GrEP). In our earlier discussions, we began thinking about how there needs to be a simpler way for individuals with non-technical backgrounds to utilize the capabilities of plotting mathematical functions. Our software will provide this solution.\r\n\r\n##Screenshots\r\n![screenshot new gui](gui1.png)\r\n![screenshot filled gui](gui.png)\r\n![screenshot new plot](plot.png)\r\n\r\n##Concepts Demonstrated\r\nIdentify the OPL concepts demonstrated in your project. Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient. \r\n* **Data abstraction** is used to provide access to the elements of the RSS feed.\r\n* The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with **recursive data structures.**\r\n* **Symbolic language processing techniques** are used in the parser.\r\n\r\n##External Technology and Libraries\r\nBriefly describe the existing technology you utilized, and how you used it. Provide a link to that technology(ies).\r\n\r\n##Favorite Lines of Code\r\n####Mark (a team member)\r\nEach team member should identify a favorite line of code, expression, or procedure written by them, and explain what it does. Why is it your favorite? What OPL philosophy does it embody?\r\nRemember code looks something like this:\r\n```scheme\r\n(map (lambda (x) (foldr compose functions)) data)\r\n```\r\n####Lillian (another team member)\r\nThis expression reads in a regular expression and elegantly matches it against a pre-existing hashmap....\r\n```scheme\r\n(let* ((expr (convert-to-regexp (read-line my-in-port)))\r\n             (matches (flatten\r\n                       (hash-map *words*\r\n                                 (lambda (key value)\r\n                                   (if (regexp-match expr key) key '()))))))\r\n  matches)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Additional Remarks\r\nAnything else you want to say in your report. Can rename or remove this section.\r\n\r\n#How to Download and Run\r\nYou may want to link to your latest release for easy downloading by people (such as Mark).\r\n\r\nInclude what file to run, what to do with that file, how to interact with the app when its running, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
