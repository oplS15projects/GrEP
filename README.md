# FP7-webpage Title of Project
This is a template for using your repo's README.md as your project web page. 
I recommend you copy and paste into your README file. Delete this line and the one above it, customize everything else. Make it look good!

##Overview
A brief description of the project is given here.  The description is 1 to 3 sentences long.  Be concise and clear.

##Screenshot
(insert a screenshot here. You may opt to get rid of the title for it. You need at least one screenshot. Make it actually appear here, don't just add a link.)

Here's a demonstration of how to display an image that's uploaded to this repo:

##Concepts Demonstrated
Identify the OPL concepts demonstrated in your project. Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient. 
* **Data abstraction** is used to provide access to the elements of the RSS feed.
* The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with **recursive data structures.**
* **Symbolic language processing techniques** are used in the parser.

##External Technology and Libraries
Briefly describe the existing technology you utilized, and how you used it. Provide a link to that technology(ies).

##Favorite Lines of Code
####Mark (a team member)
Each team member should identify a favorite line of code, expression, or procedure written by them, and explain what it does. Why is it your favorite? What OPL philosophy does it embody?
Remember code looks something like this:
```scheme
(map (lambda (x) (foldr compose functions)) data)
```
####Lillian (another team member)
This expression reads in a regular expression and elegantly matches it against a pre-existing hashmap....
```scheme

Concepts Demonstrated

Identify the OPL concepts demonstrated in your project. Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient.

Using smaller procedures to accomplish bigger tasks. 

Data abstraction is used to provide access to the elements of the RSS feed.
The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with recursive data structures.
Symbolic language processing techniques are used in the parser.
External Technology and Libraries



Briefly describe the existing technology you utilized, and how you used it. Provide a link to that technology(ies).



Favorite Lines of Code

Each team member should identify a favorite line of code, expression, or procedure written by them, and explain what it does. Why is it your favorite? What OPL philosophy does it embody? Remember code looks something like this:

This expression reads in a regular expression and elegantly matches it against a pre-existing hashmap....

>>>>>>> upstream/master
(let* ((expr (convert-to-regexp (read-line my-in-port)))
             (matches (flatten
                       (hash-map *words*
                                 (lambda (key value)
                                   (if (regexp-match expr key) key '()))))))
  matches)
